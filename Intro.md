Course Syllabus for "CS410: Advanced Databases"
-----------------------------------------------

While [CS403: Introduction to Modern Database
Systems](http://www.saylor.org/courses/cs403/) covered many of the core
concepts behind database management systems, there are many other
considerations that should be addressed if you intend to pursue a career
in this field.  This course will expand upon what you learned about SQL
in CS403 and introduce various other advanced topics, including query
optimization, concurrency, data warehouses, object-oriented extensions,
and XML.  While CS403 introduced the basics of database management
systems, the additional topics covered in this course will help you
become more proficient in writing queries and will expand your knowledge
base so that you have a better understanding of the field.  By the end
of this course, you should have a solid grasp on data warehouses and
XML, which will prove to be invaluable as you progress further in your
Computer Science studies.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

-   Write complex queries, including full outer joins, self-joins, sub
    queries, and set theoretic queries.
-   Write stored procedures and triggers.
-   Apply the principles of query optimization to a database schema.
-   Explain the various types of locking mechanisms utilized within
    database management systems.
-   Explain the different types of database failures as well as the
    methods used to recover from these failures.
-   Design queries against a distributed database management system.
-   Perform queries against database designed with object-relational
    extensions.
-   Develop and query XML files.

### Course Requirements

In order to take this course, you must:  
  
 √    Have access to a computer.  
  
 √    Have continuous broadband Internet access.  
  
 √    Have the ability/permission to install plug-ins (e.g. Adobe Reader

[CS202](http://www.saylor.org/courses/cs202/),
[CS301](http://www.saylor.org/courses/cs301/),
and [CS403](http://www.saylor.org/courses/cs403/) from the Computer
Science discipline.  
  
 √    Have completed [MA101](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma101-exc).

### Course Information

Welcome to CS410.  Below, please find general information on this course
and its requirements. 

**Course Designer:  **Charles W. Lively, III

**Primary Resources:**

-   W3uap.blogspot.com: Yale University: Avi Silberschatz, et al.’s
    [Database System
    Concepts](http://w3uap.blogspot.com/2010/08/database-system-concepts-avi.html)
-   University of Zurich: Michael Böhlen’s [Data Warehousing and Data
    Mining Lecture
    Notes](https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/boehlen/dis/teaching/DWDM08/#Lectures)
-   Duke University: Jun Yang’s [Advanced Database Systems Lecture
    Notes](http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring05/cps216/LectureNotes.html)
-   YouTube: Indian Institute of Technology Bangladore: S. Srinath’s
    [Video Lectures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYQZpYEaNvk)
-   Gonzaga University: Shawn Bozer’s [Database Management Systems
    Lectures](http://www.cs.gonzaga.edu/~bowers/courses/cpsc421-f09/)

**Requirements for Completion:  **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Specifically, be sure to focus on the tutorial exercises provided in
Unit 1 to ensure a strong understanding of the SQL commands.

Please be aware that your mastery of the course material and final grade
will be represented by your grade on the Final Exam.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **97** hours
to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount
of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help
you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 10.5 hours.  Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1 and
1.2 (a total of 4 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.3 (a total of 3
hours) on Tuesday night; etc.

**Tips/Suggestions: ** As noted in the “Course Requirements,”
Introduction to Modern Databases is a pre-requisite for this course. 
Please ensure that you have successfully completed this course and have
a strong understanding of the fundamentals of SQL.
