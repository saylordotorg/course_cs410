**Unit 5: Database System Architectures** <span id="5"></span> 
*Databases often need to be distributed across a number of different
locations, especially because today’s global companies need to be able
to access data in multiple locations.  While one copy of a database
could reside in a location and be accessed remotely, it is often more
efficient and reliable to replicate data across servers or to have
portions of data on databases that share access across locations.  In
this unit, we will study distributed databases and related issues.*
