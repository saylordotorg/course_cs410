**Unit 7: Object-Oriented and Object-Relational Databases** <span
id="7"></span> 
*As object-oriented programming gained popularity in the 1990s,
object-oriented database management systems that incorporated all of the
principles of object-oriented design began to emerge.  A short time
later, a hybrid approach known as object-relational databases was
adopted.  In this unit, you will first learn about object-oriented
databases and then object-relational extensions to relational database
management systems.*

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Identify and describe the components and characteristics of the
    object-oriented data model.
-   Describe the role that query processing has on object-oriented
    databases.
-   Identify and describe the components and characteristics of the
    object-relational database systems.
-   Explain the object-relational data model.
