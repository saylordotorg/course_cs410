**Unit 6: Data Warehousing** <span id="6"></span> 
*Traditionally, database management systems have been used for
transaction processing.  Recently, however, the field has seen a trend
of creating separate data stores for the purposes of reporting and
tracking historical data.  In this unit, you will learn about data
warehouses and how they are implemented.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 12 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.1: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.2: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.3: 4 hours

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Identify and describe the components and characteristics of Data
    Warehouses.
-   Demonstrate the appropriate syntax for SQL OLAP Extensions.
-   Understand how to use the algebraic operator for OLAP queries.
